The Approval process is where the access form is submitted by the  requester

in the mail. Once the  all  work  list  task  is  completed  (Approved)  and
finally the request is approved by all the approvers, the  request  triggers
the Service desk to create required change orders and they are sent  to  the
fulfillment
Each  change  order  created  by  the  Service  desk  is  assign  with   the
fulfillment groups. Once the fulfillment  is  done  (providing  access)  the
fulfillment group member has to clear the task from the work  list.  Thus  a

status of the request is changed to complete in the service catalog.

data from origination activities  through  to  sanctioning.  CaS  is  a  key

Project #5
    Title :  Starlight –Wrappers
    Client : Lloyds TSB - UK.
The standard out of the box approach to deploying  a  Chordiant  application
means that all functionality (i.e. business processes) has to be built  into
a single application making  all  projects  delivering  processes  into  the
desktop co-dependent on a single deployment package.
Lloyds TSB want to break this “constraint” and instead wants to be  able  to
build and deploy groups of business processes separately and  “launch”  them
from the Foundation Desktop. 
Therefore, Lloyds TSB needs to develop  a  launch  architecture  which  will
both allow the separation of the architecture but still allow us to use  all
the out of the box functions.
One of the key areas of the launch architecture is the “wrapping” up  of  an
externally supplied process. Standard Chordiant business processes  will  be
delivered by different teams (FDI-Starlight & LTSB-Starlight) working  under
common Starlight program.
 Responsibility : Involved in development and Testing.
Software : Chordiant Framework, Wepsphere 6.0, Oracle 10g, RAD,  Clearcase..
